Libraries
---------
Most of the libraries are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/) except of the
following:

* [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/): We use a 
  [patched version](https://github.com/msrocka/Chart.js). 

* For stacked bar charts we use 
  [Chart.StackedBar.js](https://github.com/Regaddi/Chart.StackedBar.js), 
  which is a plugin for Chart.js.
